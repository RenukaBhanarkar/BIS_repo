It links South Africa with Sudan via landing points in Mozambique, Madagascar, the Comoros, Tanzania, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti. The cable incorporates the latest developments in submarine fibre-optic technology, making it economical to connect the eastern and southern coast of Africa into the high-speed global telecommunications network. The system is owned and operated by a group of 16 African (92%) and international (8%) telecommunications operators and service providers.</p>

<p>EASSy is the highest capacity system serving sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 10Tbps, 2 fibre-pair configuration. It is the first to deliver direct connectivity between east Africa and Europe / North America. It is also the only system with built-in resilience end-to-end. EASSy interconnects with multiple international submarine cable networks for diverse, seamless onward connectivity to Europe, the Americas, the Middle East and Asia.</p>
